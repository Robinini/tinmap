## Development status (as of Jan 2024)

This is a deveopment version and is likely to change. Not ready for use.

This is the first working version of my second NPM/JS package, created for use with OpenLayers.

It will be continually tested and improved. Open to [hints and tips](https://github.com/Robinini/tinmap/issues) from the community.
